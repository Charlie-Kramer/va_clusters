# va_clusters

An excellent article by [Dwayne Yancey in Cardinal News](https://cardinalnews.org/2023/10/11/10-important-things-about-this-years-virginia-elections/) got me thinking about the politics and geography of Virginia. I realized that despite growing up in Virginia and spending my whole life except for two years here, I didn't know that much about the state outside where I'd lived (Northern and Central Virginia). I became especially curious about pockets of cultural and economic diversity in Virginia's regions.

So for a school project, I decided to use data by census tract to find clusters of commonality based on cultural and socio-economic characteristics. Here's a really brief summary. ([This paper](https://github.com/Charlie-Kramer/va_clusters/blob/main/Va_clusters.pdf) has all the technical details in it, if you're interested).
